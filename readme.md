# NotLinq
Like the name would suggest, this is not LINQ. It's fairly similiar - in fact,
it's designed to mirror most (if not all) of the nifty features of LINQ (note
that I can't actually integrate this functionality natively). Basically, this
project is a culmination of utilities that I've found myself needing for
multiple projects.
